OONI extensions to the `net` and `net/http` packages. This code is
used by `ooni/probe-engine` as a low level library to collect
network, DNS, and HTTP events occurring during OONI measurements.

## API documentation

This library contains replacements for commonly used standard library
interfaces that facilitate seamless network measurements. By using
such replacements, as opposed to standard library interfaces, we can:

* save the timing of HTTP events (e.g. received response headers)
* save the timing and result of every Connect, Read, Write, Close operation
* save the timing and result of the TLS handshake (including certificates)

By default, this library uses the DNS resolving policy preferred by
Go on a specific platform. When the pure Go resolver is used, this
allows us to intercept and save DNS messages as well. In addition, it
is possible to configure alternative DNS transports and remote
servers. We support DNS over UDP, DNS over TCP, DNS over TLS (DoT),
and DNS over HTTPS (DoH). When using an alternative transport, we
are also able to intercept and save DNS messages, as well as any
other interaction with the remote server (e.g., the result of the
TLS handshake for DoT and DoH).

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ooni/netx/httpx?status.svg)](

Implements a replacement for `http.Client` that saves the timing and
results of HTTP and network events.

Ways to attach event handlers to `context.Context` and `*http.Request` to
get only the events pertaining to such context or request routed to the
specified handler. This allows one to cleanly separate at the source the
events generated by different, possibly parallel, requests.

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ooni/netx?status.svg)](

Implements a replacement for `net.Dialer` that saves the timing and
results of network events.

### github.com/ooni/netx/dnsx

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ooni/netx/dnsx?status.svg)](
https://godoc.org/github.com/ooni/netx/dnsx)

Implements a relacement for `net.Resolver` that saves the timing and
content of DNS packets. Allows to use several transports for DNS
queries and replies, including DoT and DoH.

### Other packages

There are other utility and internal packages. Their documentation
is reachable from [the netx online documentation](
https://godoc.org/github.com/ooni/netx#pkg-subdirectories).

## Build, run tests, run example commands

You need Go >= 1.11. We use Go modules.

To run tests:

```
GO111MODULE=on go test -v -race ./...
```

To build the example commands:

```
GO111MODULE=on go build -v ./cmd/dnsclient
GO111MODULE=on go build -v ./cmd/httpclient
```

Both commands will provide useful help messages when run with `-help`. When
run without arguments they run against default input suitable to show
at a first glance their functionality. They both emit the events they have
measured on the standard ouput, using the JSONL format (i.e. newline
separated serialized JSON documents).
